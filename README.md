# Parallel Data Processing on a HPC Cluster 

Implementing a python script to perform data processing on a HPC Cluster. 
This project  involved reading a large dataset, performing some data transformations, and writing 
the processed data back to the disk. The goal is to show case my ablity to utilize HPC reasources for efficent data processing.
